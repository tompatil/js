Node.js and Express are both technologies commonly used in web development, but they serve different purposes:

Node.js:

Definition: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is used for server-side scripting.
Key Features: It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications.
Express:

Definition: Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
Key Features: Express simplifies the process of writing server-side logic, handling routes, managing sessions, and more, by providing a layer of abstraction over raw Node.js HTTP modules.
Comparison:

Node.js forms the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side.
Express is a framework that runs on Node.js and simplifies the process of building web applications by providing a set of features and utilities.
In summary, Node.js is the core runtime environment, while Express is a framework that sits on top of Node.js and provides additional utilities and features for building web applications.

Express:

Provides a higher-level abstraction for building web applications.
Simplifies routing, middleware handling, and other common web application tasks.
Offers a more structured way to organize and handle requests compared to the raw http module.
Node.js http Module:

Basic functionality for creating an HTTP server.
Requires manual handling of routing, request parsing, and response generation.
Offers lower-level control over HTTP requests and responses compared to Express.
Choosing Between Them:

Use Express when building a web application that requires routing, middleware, and more advanced features out of the box.
Use Node.js http module if you need fine-grained control over HTTP server operations or if you're building a simple server without needing the features provided by Express.
In essence, Express builds on top of Node.js's http module to provide a more feature-rich and developer-friendly environment for building web applications.
