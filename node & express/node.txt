Node.js is an open source server environment.

Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server.

1) modules-
modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.set of functions
  include a module, use the require() function 
  
  own module 
  exports.myDateTime = function () {
  return Date();
}; sAVE AS myfirstmodule.JS

var dt = require('./myfirstmodule');

Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).



2)create an HTTP server:
Use the createServer() method to create an HTTP server:
var http = require('http');

//create a server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.write('Hello World!'); //write a response to the client
  res.end(); //end the response
}).listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080

3)The URL module
 splits up a web address into readable parts.
var url = require('url');
var adr = 'http://localhost:8080/default.htm?year=2017&month=february';
var q = url.parse(adr, true);

console.log(q.host); //returns 'localhost:8080'
console.log(q.pathname); //returns '/default.htm'
console.log(q.search); //returns '?year=2017&month=february'

var qdata = q.query; //returns an object: { year: 2017, month: 'february' }
console.log(qdata.month); //returns 'february'


4)npm
A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module.

Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project.

5)
package.json
in Node.js is a metadata file that contains project-specific information such as dependencies, scripts, version, author details, and other configuration settingsrequired for managing and building the project.
‘npm init -y’ for default initialization


npm init
6)REPL,cluster,)REPL buffer Streams  Timers body parser cookie parser cors


7)most used framework
Express.js as it is highly scalable, efficient, and requires very few lines of code to create an application
 provides broad features for building web and mobile applications
 
8)routes =endpoint

For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service.


8Timers

The setImmediate function is used to execute a particular script immediately whereas the setTimeout function is used to hold a function and execute it after a specifiedperiod of time.


9) spawn fork
Both these methods are used to create new child processes the only difference between them is that 
spawn() method creates a new function that Node runs from the command line whereas
 fork() function creates an instance of the existing fork() method and creates multiple workers to perform on the same task.


10)passport module
The passport module is used for adding authentication features to our website or web app. It implements authentication measure which helps to perform sign-in operations.


11)tls module in Node.js?
The tls module provides an implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocols that are built on top of OpenSSL. It helps toestablish a secure connection on the network.

12)parsing
parsing means to analyze or break up something )
